Is It Worth It?
The Cayenne Turbo GT is for those who
 want supercar performance in an SUV. It’s one of the fastest SUVs on the market, competing with models like the Lamborghini Urus and Aston Martin DBX707. However,
 it’s not meant for off-roading like some other Cayenne models—this one is all about on-road performance.
